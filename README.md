Secured Data Hiding in Images Using Steganography
This project implements image-based steganography using Python and OpenCV to securely hide messages within images. It ensures data confidentiality by embedding secret messages in image pixels with minimal distortion.

Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python üêç
Libraries: OpenCV,.etc
Platforms: Windows, Linux
Features:
‚úÖ Least Significant Bit (LSB) Steganography for undetectable data hiding.
‚úÖ Password Protection to restrict unauthorized access.
‚úÖ Cross-Platform Compatibility for ease of use.
‚úÖ Lightweight & Fast Execution for efficient performance.

Future Scope:
Integration of AES encryption for enhanced security.
Support for video and audio steganography.
Development of a web or mobile-based application.
